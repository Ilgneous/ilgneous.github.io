As a Mechanical Engineering student at Texas A&M, I’ve immersed myself in CAD design and machining through various organizations and personal projects, and I'm very passionate about automotive engineering.

Your internship stands out to me because of Roush’s innovative work and commitment to creativity. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, especially the mechanics of cars, and I’m eager to apply my technical skills and creative thinking to your projects.

My experience with CAD tools and understanding of mechanical systems make me a strong fit for this role. I’m ready to tackle the challenges at Roush and contribute to the team to the best of my ability.

I look forward to the possibility of working with Roush and am available for an interview at your convenience. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
