## Problem
I wanted a central place to showcase my projects, technical skills, and interactive demos. GitHub alone doesn’t highlight design, documentation, or narrative. I also wanted to experiment with modern frontend + backend frameworks.

## Approach
- **Frontend:** Astro with Svelte components for interactivity (project counters, demos). TailwindCSS for rapid styling.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints like `/api/projects`.  
- **Content:** Astro Content Collections for structured Markdown-based project pages.  
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages for the frontend, with deployment scripts.  
- **Extras:** OpenGraph tags for nice link previews, and RSS feed for future blog posts.

## Impact
- Professional-looking portfolio at a custom domain.  
- Scalable content: adding new projects is just creating a `.md` file.  
- Clearer project storytelling using Problem → Approach → Impact → Tech format.  
- Learned full-stack workflow (Astro + Svelte + FastAPI + CI/CD).  

## Tech
- Astro, Svelte, TailwindCSS for frontend  
- FastAPI (Python) for backend  
- GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions for deployment  
- Markdown + Astro Content Collections for content
