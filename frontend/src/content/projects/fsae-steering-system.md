## Problem
Deliver precise steering with high stiffness and low mass under racing loads and packaging constraints.

## Approach
- Concept + gear ratio selection; packaging within nose cone.
- FEA on shafts/housings to meet stiffness and safety factors.
- Carbon-fiber layup and optimized aluminum/CNC parts.
- Assembly, lash measurement, and track-side validation.

## Impact
- Mass reduction vs. prior design and improved steering precision.
- Serviceable design with clear assembly and inspection points.

## Tech
- Mechanics: gear train, backlash control
- Materials: CFRP layup strategy
- Tools: SolidWorks, FEA, CNC workflows
