## Problem
Model and optimize race‑car handling and stability under constraints.

## Approach
- Built kinematic models and implemented Milliken Moment Method for balance and handling analysis.
- Developed a compliance model to study structural deflections and their effects on dynamics.
- Prototyped in Python, ported performance‑critical pieces to C++.

## Impact
- Improved setup targets and design decisions through faster, higher‑fidelity simulations.
- Enabled collision‑detection studies for packaging constraints.

## Tech
- Methods: Milliken Moment Method, kinematic solvers
- SW: Python protos, C++ core modules
