## Problem
Send robust serial data between two nodes without wires or RF modules in lab/robot settings.

## Approach
- 38â€“56 kHz carrier modulation; UART framing with CRC.
- Ambient-light rejection and AGC via comparator threshold tuning.
- Scope-based eye diagram checks; BER tests vs. range/angle.

## Impact
- Reliable short-range link (line-of-sight) for debugging and control.
- Drop-in firmware library for other projects needing cable-free serial.

## Tech
- HW: IR LED driver, photodiode transimpedance, carrier modulation
- SW: UART driver, CRC, framing/state machine
