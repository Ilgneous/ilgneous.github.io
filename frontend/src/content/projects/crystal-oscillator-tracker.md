## Problem
Characterize frequency drift and short-term stability of a reference crystal with low-cost hardware.

## Approach
- Timer capture on rising edges â†’ period estimate with fractional averaging.
- Sliding-window outlier rejection; optional DFT-based refinement on edge timestamps.
- Serial logging to CSV; Python notebook for Allan-style stability plots.

## Impact
- Reliable drift trending for different crystals and temperatures.
- Reusable measurement firmware for future timing experiments.

## Tech
- HW: MCU timer/capture, level shifting, stable supply decoupling
- SW: C (interrupt-driven), Python analysis (pandas/numpy)
